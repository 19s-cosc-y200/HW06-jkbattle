	<h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>
	<dl>
		<dt><strong>What is a yurt?</strong></dt>
			<dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt is<br/> 
			fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.
			</dd>
		<dt><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></dt>
			<dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove.<br/>
			Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold <br/>
			running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.
			</dd>
		<dt><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt>
			<dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather<br/>
			with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
